The XmlDeserializeConfigSectionHandler class for easy deserialization of
custom ConfigSections is from Mark Focas at
  http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/6730/Custom-Objects-From-the-App-Config-file
  via http://codecutout.com/xml-deserialization-from-app-config

The code to examine the currently running MSBuild project and extract its
properties was based on code from http://simoncropp.com/getprojectpathanmsbuildtask
and http://simoncropp.com/howtoaccessbuildvariablesfromanmsbuildtask.

The class GUIConsoleWriter which allows WinForms apps to write to the
console window, which is used by ConfigZilla.Encrypter when run in command
line mode, is from this Stack Overflow question:
  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14199850/writing-output-to-the-console-from-a-c-sharp-winforms-application

The MSBuild Community Tasks project at https://github.com/loresoft/msbuildtasks
and the MSBuild Extension pack at http://msbuildextensionpack.codeplex.com/
provided some inspiration, especially for PowerShell and NuGet.
