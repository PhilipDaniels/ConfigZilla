This website is built with Docpad, a static site generator that runs on top
of node. I typically clone the repo onto a Linux box with Node and npm
installed then do

  $ npm install
  $ docpad run

to compile the site and start a webserver.

See http://docpad.org/ for more info.

At some point this will probably get ported to Assemble.io.
